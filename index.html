        <dd>  Our main task this week is to write the project plan. First of all, we identified the five most important keywords of snake detection and rescue robots: snake, detection, rescue, communication, obstacle avoidance. By expanding on these five key points, we identify the main problems that may be faced and the expected solutions. This section includes: What device or method will we use, and how will we run it and verify its functionality

According to the problems we faced and the overall and partial design drawings completed last week, we met with Teacher Li Qi this Wednesday to discuss and revise some contents. In the future, we will gradually refine our project plan and show it on our blog
